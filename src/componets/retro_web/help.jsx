      <p>1. Every app is either a fun project I built or informative content as per the app title.</p>
      <p>2. Double-clicking icons opens the project / content within.</p>
      <p>3. The app window claims to provide the similar experience as a desktop window.</p>
      <p>4. Dragging the window around is possible but may cause lag if over-used.</p>
      <p>5. You can toggle the theme and bg music as well at the bottom right corner. </p>
      <p>5. Hope you , Enjoy :)</p>
